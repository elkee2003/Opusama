                    review:'I stayed at 456 Oak Avenue for six months and had a wonderful experience. The house is spacious and tastefully decorated, with plenty of natural light throughout. The kitchen is modern and fully equipped, making cooking enjoyable. The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and a large walk-in closet, which was a nice touch. The backyard is private and well-maintained, perfect for outdoor activities. The location is convenient, close to shopping centers, restaurants, and public transportation. The landlord was friendly and quick to address any concerns. I highly recommend this home to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish place to live.',

The open-concept living area is perfect for entertaining, and the kitchen is a chefs dream with top-of-the-line appliances. The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable, with plenty of storage. The backyard patio was a favorite spot for morning coffee and evening relaxation. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, with excellent schools and parks nearby. The landlord was professional and made the rental process smooth and hassle-free. I would definitely recommend this property to anyone seeking a luxurious rental experience.',

The windows were drafty, leading to high heating bills in the winter. The bathrooms were outdated and had mold issues. The backyard was small and not as described in the listing. The landlord was difficult to deal with and took weeks to address even minor repairs. The overall living conditions were subpar, and I would not recommend this property to anyone.',

The kitchen appliances were old and malfunctioning, making it difficult to cook. The heating system was unreliable, which was a major issue during the colder months. The neighborhood was noisy, and there were frequent disturbances late at night. The landlord was unresponsive to complaints and seemed uninterested in addressing the issues. Overall, this rental was not worth the money, and I would advise potential renters to look elsewhere.',

The interior was outdated, and several appliances were in need of repair. The plumbing issues were particularly frustrating, with frequent leaks and low water pressure. The bedrooms were small and lacked adequate storage. The backyard, which was supposed to be a highlight, was overgrown and not well-maintained. The landlord was slow to respond to maintenance requests, which added to the frustration. I wouldnt recommend this property until significant improvements are made.',
