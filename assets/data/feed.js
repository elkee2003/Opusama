The interior was outdated, and several appliances were in need of repair. The plumbing issues were particularly frustrating, with frequent leaks and low water pressure. The bedrooms were small and lacked adequate storage. The backyard, which was supposed to be a highlight, was overgrown and not well-maintained. The landlord was slow to respond to maintenance requests, which added to the frustration. I wouldnt recommend this property until significant improvements are made.',
